		I am currently a PhD student at the <a href="http://www.soton.ac.uk">University of Southampton</a>, working within the <a href="http://www.icss.soton.ac.uk">Institute for Complex Systems Simulation</a> (an interdisciplinary group working to understand and simulate complex systems in a wide variety of areas). I am focussing on complexity within remote sensing. <a href="complexity">Read more</a>

		<h6>Previous Work</h6>
		<p>I completed a BSc Geography degree at the University of Southampton from 2007-2010, graduating with a first class mark and gaining the highest mark out of all 166 geography students in my year. During this time I specialised in remote sensing, writing a <a href="dissertation">dissertation</a> on a method of automating atmospheric correction using the Empirical Line Method.</p>
		
		<p>During my degree I also completed many other <a href="undergrad_work">pieces of coursework</a>, many of which gained first class marks.</p>
		
		<p>In the summer holiday between my second and third year I did an <a href="http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/">EPSRC</a> funded <a href="bursary">bursary project</a>, working with my dissertation supervisor on some remote sensing calibration/validation projects.</p>
