		<p class="red huge hand center">Remote sensing is awesome!</p>
		
		<p class="right xxlarge line">Don't believe me? This page <strike>will</strike> should convince you.</p>
			
		<p class="line xlarge nogap">If I've sent you here so you can have some idea of what I'm doing for my PhD then it's nice to see you!</p>
		<p class="large line right">If not, then it's still nice to see you! Why don't you <a href="contact">let me know what you think of this page</a></p>
		
		<br/>

		<p class="line xlarge">So, rather than doing this in the boring textbook-style way...let's dive right in:</p>
		
		<hr/>

		<p class="line xlarge"><img src="space.jpg" class="left">Imagine that you're flying around in space - a long way up...</p>
		<p class="line right xlarge">(in fact, lets say its around 700 miles up)</p>
		
		
		
		<p class="line xlarge">Now, when you heard that you were gonna get to go on this <strong>trip of a lifetime</strong>, you decided you'd better bring your camera with you - and hey, who can blame you?! I was taking <a href="potatoes.jpg">photos of roast potatoes</a> the other day - and space is far more exciting than that!</p>
		
		<p class="line xlarge right">Now, as you're flying around you look down and take some photos of the Earth's surface below you. If you brought those photos back to Earth, what could you do with them?</p>
		
		<p class="line xlarge"><img src="bluemarble.jpg" class="right"><strong>1)</strong> Well, you could just look at them - they are quite pretty aren't they?</p>
		<p class="line xlarge">But what if you wanted to do something, a bit more...well...ummm...useful with them?</p>
		<p class="line xlarge"><strong>2)</strong> How about looking at farmers fields and telling them how healthy their crops are?</p>
		<p class="line xlarge center">or even...</p>
		<p class="line xlarge"><strong>3)</strong> Automatically making a map of anywhere on Earth - down to every individual metre!</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="line huge center">Well...<br/>these can all be done using <strong class="red">remote sensing</strong>!</p>
		<p class="line xlarge center">You've gotta admit, that is pretty awesome!</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="line xlarge">So, you can leave now if you want...</p>
		<p class="right line xlarge ">...but hang around if you want to find out <strong>how</strong> this all works</p>
