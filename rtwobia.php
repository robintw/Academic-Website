        <p>This is still very much a work in progress, but it is designed to be a free, open-source <a href="http://www.definiens.com/">eCognition</a> replacement. The name is pronounced <em>arr-two-bia</em>, as is a combination of my intials with the acronym for Object-based Image Analysis.</p>
        <p>Flexibility and customisability are the key features, and it should allow more complex class definitions than eCognition (for example, there will be far more flexibility in defining 'Customised Features') and will be flexible in the type of segmentation and classification which will be performed.</p>
        
        <p>All code is available at the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rtwobia/">RTWOBIA Google Code Repository</a>.
